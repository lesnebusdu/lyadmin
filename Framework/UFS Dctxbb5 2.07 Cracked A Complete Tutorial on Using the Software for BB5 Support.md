One way to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks is to store a secret token in a hidden form field that only your site can access. This token acts as a proof that the request came from your site and not from a malicious third-party site. However, this method requires you to check the validity of the hidden field on the server side before processing the request. Another possible prevention technique is to ask for a password confirmation before allowing the user to modify sensitive settings (such as changing the password reminder email). This can help protect your site from exploiting abandoned sessions on public computers, where an attacker may use the browser's back button or history to access your site without logging in.

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is a type of web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to trick a user into performing actions on a website that they did not intend to. For example, an attacker may embed a malicious link or image in an email or a forum post that sends a request to a website where the user is already logged in. The website may then execute the request as if it came from the user, without verifying its origin.
  
CSRF attacks can have serious consequences for both the user and the website. For instance, an attacker may use CSRF to change the user's password, email address, or account settings; transfer funds from the user's bank account; post spam or malicious content on the user's behalf; or even take over the user's account completely. For the website, CSRF attacks can damage its reputation, cause data loss or corruption, or expose sensitive information.
  
Therefore, it is important for web developers to implement proper CSRF prevention measures on their websites. Some of the common methods are using secret tokens, checking the referer header, using same-site cookies, or requiring user interaction. These methods aim to ensure that only legitimate requests from the website are processed and that any unauthorized requests are rejected.
  
Secret tokens are random strings that are generated by the website and stored in a hidden form field or a cookie. The website then verifies that the token matches the one stored on the server before processing the request. This way, only requests that have the correct token can be executed. Secret tokens can prevent CSRF attacks because an attacker cannot guess or obtain the token from a third-party site.

The referer header is a HTTP header that indicates the origin of a request. The website can check the referer header and compare it with its own domain name before processing the request. This way, only requests that come from the same origin can be executed. The referer header can prevent CSRF attacks because an attacker cannot spoof or modify the header from a third-party site.
  
Same-site cookies are cookies that have a special attribute that tells the browser to only send them with requests that originate from the same site as the cookie. The website can use same-site cookies to authenticate the user and reject any requests that do not have the cookie. Same-site cookies can prevent CSRF attacks because an attacker cannot access or send the cookie from a third-party site.
  
User interaction is a method that requires the user to perform some action, such as clicking a button, entering a captcha, or confirming a dialog box, before processing the request. User interaction can prevent CSRF attacks because an attacker cannot force or trick the user into performing the action from a third-party site.
