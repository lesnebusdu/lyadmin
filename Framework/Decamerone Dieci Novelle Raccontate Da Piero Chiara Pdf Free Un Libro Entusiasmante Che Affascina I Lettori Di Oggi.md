# Decamerone Dieci Novelle Raccontate Da Piero Chiara Pdf Free: A Modern Translation of Boccaccio's Classic Tales
  
The Decameron is a collection of 100 stories written by Giovanni Boccaccio in the 14th century, depicting the lives, loves, and adventures of a group of young people who flee from Florence during the Black Death. The stories are rich in humor, irony, wit, and wisdom, and offer a vivid portrait of medieval society and culture.
  
However, reading the original text can be challenging for modern readers, who may find the language and style outdated and difficult to understand. That's why Piero Chiara, a renowned Italian writer of the 20th century, decided to "translate" the Decameron into a more accessible and contemporary language, without losing the charm and flavor of Boccaccio's masterpiece. He selected 10 stories from the Decameron and retold them in his own words, preserving the plot, the characters, and the moral lessons of each tale.
