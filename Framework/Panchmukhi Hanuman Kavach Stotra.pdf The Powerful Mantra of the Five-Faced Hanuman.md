The stotra consists of a dhyana (meditation), a kavach (armor), and a mantra (invocation). The dhyana describes the appearance and attributes of the five-faced Hanuman, who has the faces of a monkey, a lion, an eagle, a boar, and a horse. Each face represents a different aspect of Hanuman's power and grace. The kavach lists the various weapons and symbols that Hanuman holds in his ten hands, such as a sword, a trident, a mace, a lotus, and a water pot. The mantra invokes the five faces of Hanuman with different bija (seed) syllables and praises his qualities and deeds.
 
The stotra is said to have been composed by Lord Brahma, the creator of the universe, and revealed to Garuda, the divine eagle and mount of Lord Vishnu.

Hanuman chanted this stotra and assumed his gigantic form with five faces and ten arms. He then flew across the ocean and performed many heroic feats in Lanka.
